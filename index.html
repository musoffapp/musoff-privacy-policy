  <h1>Privacy Policy for Musoff</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Musoff (“we”, “our”, or “us”) collects information to provide a personalized and secure experience. This includes authentication data such as email address, Firebase User ID, and authentication provider (Google/Apple). We also collect user activity data, including diary entries of positive achievements, streaks (days music-free), music avoidance statistics, Quran listening time, and onboarding responses. Some onboarding responses, such as age range, goals, and referral source, are stored in plaintext, while more sensitive responses like music listening frequency and reasons are encrypted. Additionally, sensitive events such as “listened to music” actions are encrypted and stored in Supabase. Device information like iOS version and device type is also collected.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information collected to provide core app functionality, including syncing progress across devices, processing subscriptions via RevenueCat, sending push notifications, and improving app performance. Data is also used to track streaks, motivate users with Islamic reminders, and provide an alternative to music through Quran audio and motivational content.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>Data is stored both locally and remotely. Sensitive information is encrypted in Keychain and UserDefaults on the device. Remote storage is provided via Supabase, with sensitive data encrypted before transmission. Firebase Analytics is enabled to help us improve the app experience, but users may opt out. We implement industry-standard security practices to protect your information.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Musoff uses several third-party services: <strong>Firebase (Google)</strong> for authentication and analytics (<a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>), <strong>Supabase</strong> for database backend (<a href="https://supabase.com/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>), <strong>RevenueCat</strong> for subscription management (<a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>), <strong>Google Sign-In</strong> (<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>), and <strong>Apple Sign-In</strong> (<a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>). These services may access certain user data as needed to provide their functionality.</p>

  <h2>5. Permissions Requested</h2>
  <p>The app requests the following permissions: Family Controls / Screen Time API to block music apps and monitor usage, push notifications for daily reminders, and background audio to play Quran content while using other apps.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data. Some information is stored in Supabase for syncing purposes, and subscription data is processed by RevenueCat. Data is only shared with third parties as necessary to provide app functionality.</p>

  <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
  <p>Users have the right to access their data, request deletion, and opt out of analytics tracking. Account deletion removes data from both local storage and Supabase. For requests or questions regarding your data, contact us at <strong>[your email]</strong>.</p>

  <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>We collect age range during onboarding and comply with COPPA for users under 13. GDPR requirements are followed for users in the EU.</p>

  <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Data is retained as long as the account exists. Users can delete their accounts to remove personal data.</p>

  <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>Some data may be stored internationally via Supabase and Firebase. GDPR users have the right to access, delete, and request portability of their data.</p>

  <h2>11. Contact Information</h2>
  <p>For questions or concerns about this privacy policy or your personal data, contact us at <strong>[your email]</strong>.</p>
